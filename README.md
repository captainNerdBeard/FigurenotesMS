## Downloading the plugin

### On Musescore.com

On the plugin page (https://musescore.org/en/project/figurenotes-shapes-and-colours), scroll to the bottom and click the link for 'Figurenotes MS4.zip'. Your browser will download the required zip file.

### From Github

Click the link under 'Releases' on in the right hand column (https://github.com/captainNerdBeard/FigurenotesMS/releases/tag/release-1) and click the 'FigurenotesPlugin.zip' link in the next screen. Your browser will download the required zip file.

## Installing the plugin

1. Extract the .zip file by right clicking it and selecting 'Extract', after extracting you will see a folder named 'Figurenotes MS4' which contains 2 plugin files and a thumbnail image.
2. Find your Musescore plugin folder. Usually, this is "C:/Program Files/Musescore/plugins" on PC or ~/documents/musescore4/plugins on Mac. If you cannot find your plugins folder, open Musescore, Select Edit / Preferences - if you select the Folder option on the left, you'll find a list of file locations. The location of your plugins folder can be found there.
3. Copy the entire 'Figurenotes MS4' folder into Musescore's plugin folder.
4. Open Musescore and go to Home / Plugins.
5. Click on each Figurenotes Plugin in turn and click the 'Enable' Button.

## Using the plugin

1. Select the bits of the score you wish to change, OR, don't make any selection, and the plugin will change the whole score.
2. If you want to select a single note, click it, and then press [Shift+Right Arrow] which will select the note in question plus the note after it. Then press [Shift+Left Arrow], this will shrink the selection to the initial note.
3. Go to 'Plugins/Colour Notes/Figurenotes Colours' or 'Plugins/Colour Notes/Figurenotes Shapes' and select as required

## Removing the plugin

1. Open your Musescore plugin folder, select the whole 'Figurenotes MS4' folder and delete it.
2. You may need to restart Musescore for the changes to take effect.
